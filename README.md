This is my custom slackbot coded in javascript that i created for my personal channel. The current features include a welcoming feature, and a bot messaging service.

The messaging service is /wl in slack
The password for sending the message is 2048 for the moment. You can send a DM throught the bot to anyone. Please don't spam with it though!

To test the welcome bot capability, you can join #slack_bot_testing ([https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06C6JWHNBF](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06C6JWHNBF)) in the Hack Club Slack to see it in action.
